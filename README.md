# JavaScript-Quiz-App

## User info

```
Created a Quiz app Utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.
Started off with an array made up of all my questions. 
Which is nested within another array called myQuiz.
I set variables for all my selectors. Getting elements 
by id and also by className. First function(myAnswer) is 
to check for correct answer. Function(moveNext) made to 
check if a decision on an answer has been made. If answer 
has been made, then proceed with quiz. Function(checkPage) 
to add and remove disabled buttons if there are no more 
questions in que. Utilized bootstrap's progress bar. 
The progress bar increments in percentage as the questions 
are being answered. function(endQuiz) Display results from 
the quiz with check marks of all right answers and X's for 
all wrong answers.
