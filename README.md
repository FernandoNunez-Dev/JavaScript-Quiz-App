# JavaScript-Quiz-App


  Created a Quiz app Utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

-Started off with an array made up of all my questions. Which was nested within another array called myQuiz.

-I set variables for all my selectors. Getting elements by id and also by className.

-First function(myAnswer) is to check for correct answer.

-function(moveNext) made to check if a decision on an answer has been made. If answer has been made, then proceed with quiz.

-function(checkPage) to add and remove disabled buttons if there are no more questions in que.

-Utilized bootstrap's progress bar. The progress bar increments in percentage as the questions are being answered.

-function(endQuiz) Display results from the quiz with check marks of all right answers and X's for all wrong answers.
